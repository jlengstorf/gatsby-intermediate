    <h1>The History of the Negroni</h1>
    <p>
      The Negroni is a variation on a classic cocktail called an Americano,
      which is a mix of Campari, sweet vermouth, and club soda.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to legend, in 1919 in Florence, Italy, Count Negroni was on the
      hunt for a drink a little stiffer than the average Italian caffé had to
      offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the count’s request, a Florence bartender swapped out the club soda in
      the Americano for gin, and the result has lived on with the count’s name
      since.
    </p>
    <h2>The recent rise in popularity for Negronis</h2>
    <p>
      Recently, the Negroni has grown in popularity due to a resurgence in the
      popularity of craft cocktails, a revival of interest in gin, and some
      clever marketing from Campari, who acquired the Wild Turkey distillery in
      2009 and declared 2011 “The Year of the Negroni” to expand its US
      marketing efforts.
